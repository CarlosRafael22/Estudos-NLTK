Thanks to @SeemaKennedy tonight we partnered to push the case to #remain in the EU #VoteRemain
Before you blame the #eu for not being able to afford a home, just check #govt policy on housing? #voteremain #EUref
@bbcquestiontime without EU money areas outside Tory heartlands will remain underfunded #voteremain
Can't even read the #bbcqt tweets about Gove as it makes me too annoyed! #EUref #voteremain #strongerin
A smaller economy if we leave the EU. Lower standard of living, more cuts and/or taxes. #skypapers #VoteRemain
Another must read. Exposing the fantasy politics &amp; economics of the #Brexit brigade. #VoteRemain #EURef https://t.co/mzFAe9drtv
If you are for #remain remember to VOTE don't let the scaremongering win #VoteRemain #strongerIN

My Dad grew up in Grimsby. @Nigel_Farage 's flotilla was a cheap farce and an insult. That's @UKIP for you! #VoteRemain
Farage the slimy kipper #Voteremain https://t.co/gkMGgJllYl
Googling "Brexit" doesn't imply support. This is the most idiotic article I've ever read. #VoteRemain #EUreferendum https://t.co/KTJ6JA3Vyd
What ever amount of money the UK saves by leaving, I do not trust them to spend anything close to 100m a week on the NHS no way! #votestay
If this can get people to #VoteRemain I'm all for it. At least you're not telling lies. https://t.co/Ow2xhZJlhs
If Michael Gove can blatantly lie about his own father, do you think he would hesitate to lie about the EU? #VoteRemain
#bbcqt @Cookie030483 UK economy not always strong. Improved after joining EEC. UK was known as 'the sick man of Europe ' #voteremain
The recently converted Marxist; Gove has changed his tune #VoteRemain https://t.co/BYU4FAQqPd
#Brexit is getting properly terrifying now. Spread the #VoteRemain word with this brilliant piece by @CorinneSawers https://t.co/OHAKaS8GI2
